# Book-Tracker

How to use:
1. I can't figure out a way to create a PostgreSQL database from within Java, so in order to do so, you have to use the command line. I used psql, so after opening psql, enter the command "CREATE DATABASE name;", where name is the name of your database. After this step, everything can be done within Java.

In-Progress:
- storing book information in PostgreSQL
- MORE STATISTICS

To-do:
- graphs????
- GUI

Done:
- add read-date to Book class
